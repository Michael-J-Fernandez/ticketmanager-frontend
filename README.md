# Jira Clone Frontend - Final Assessment Project

A Jira-like ticket tracker built with MERN stack by 3 fullstack web dev students.

## Overview

This project aims to create a basic ticket tracker application similar to JIRA. It is the final assessment for our Web Development course and serves as an evaluation of our ability to create a fullstack MERN application.

## Tech Stack

- MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
- Additional libraries: CORS, bcryptJS, JsonWebToken, Bootstrap, Nodemon, React-Router, uuidv4

## Features

### Core Features

1. User registration and login
2. Ticket creation, editing, and deletion
3. Displaying a list of user's tickets

### Stretch Goals

1. Enhanced user authentication (password encryption, ID Tokens, logout functionality)
2. Improved ticket management (advanced fields, sorting, filtering, pagination, quick edit modal)
3. Project README

### Extended Stretch Goals

1. Organization support (admin privileges)
2. File attachments, user comments, and user tagging on tickets
3. Integration with third-party APIs

## Prioritization

We will focus on implementing the core features first, followed by the stretch goals, and finally the extended stretch goals if time permits.
